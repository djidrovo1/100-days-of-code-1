# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31st, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I have been helping people on the FreeCodeCamp/Help chatroom almost all day today. I am thinking on creating some website that will be similar to a social media site, not sure if it will be functional, but I will try. Just to expand my skills and portfolio. I will draft a "scamp" and then will ge to work on the coding hopefully by today or tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Everyone seems very thankful for my help at FCC at gitter's site. I have told them to take notes and been very patient with everyone who needed help, they keep asking me to bear with them, it seems like some people have been mean to them before. I told them not to worry that I am a very patient person and plus, I LOVE helping people with their code as I love to code and see others accomplish their goals.

### Day 1: August 1st, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I am still learning JavaScript, I find JS very cool and while I love FCC I have also branched out to other coding schools such as code school, code academy, edunix and some other on that I can't remember. I am a visual learner so I learn quicker by doing it and watching somebody do it (videos). Today I decided to put aside my JS lessons for the rest of the day and start a new project. I have seen some people make knowledge rulers and put them on their portfolio website I want to create one for myself. I honestly do not know where to start but I will post about my progress as I move along. 

**Thoughts:** I love coding and can't wait for this challenge and all the stress I am about to endure. 

**Link to work:** Nothing yet! Well, I guess here is the link to the pen where I will create this project. <a href="http://codepen.io/dario-idrovo/full/xOaOjr/">Click Here!!</a>
