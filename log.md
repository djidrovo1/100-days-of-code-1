# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31st, 2016

**Today's Progress**: I have been helping people on the FreeCodeCamp/Help chatroom almost all day today. I am thinking on creating some website that will be similar to a social media site, not sure if it will be functional, but I will try. Just to expand my skills and portfolio. I will draft a "scamp" and then will ge to work on the coding hopefully by today or tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Everyone seems very thankful for my help at FCC at gitter's site. I have told them to take notes and been very patient with everyone who needed help, they keep asking me to bear with them, it seems like some people have been mean to them before. I told them not to worry that I am a very patient person and plus, I LOVE helping people with their code as I love to code and see others accomplish their goals.
